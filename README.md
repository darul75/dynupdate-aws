# DynupdateAWS [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dynupdate-aws.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/dynupdate-aws) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/dynupdate-aws.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/dynupdate-aws) [![Total views](https://sourcegraph.com/api/repos/github.com/darul75/dynupdate-aws/counters/views.png)](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/darul75/dynupdate-aws)

**DynupdateAWS** NodeJS module to update no-ip and submit your AWS instance IP as a dynamic dns update request.

## Why ?

Because ecchymose in the nose. IP may change my friend and DNS has to be updated.

At AWS instance boot, you might want to send IP update to your no-ip DNS.

It works as a daemon and will trigger an DNS update when AWS IP instance is known.

Timer checks aws instance status about every 5 seconds, when public IP is provided, event is triggered and update request sent to no-ip.

Combined with https://github.com/chovy/node-startup on your aws instance, can be a great deal to avoid elastic IP.
